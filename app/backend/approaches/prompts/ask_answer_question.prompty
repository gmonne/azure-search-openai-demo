What is the specified concrete strength for the foundation slab in Zone B?

Sources:
Structural_Sheets.pdf#page=3: The foundation slab in Zone B shall have a minimum compressive strength of 4000 psi at 28 days.
RFI_0043.pdf: Confirmed 4000 psi concrete for Zone B as per updated structural note on Sheet S3.
SpecBook-Section03.pdf#page=12: Concrete mix design must meet minimum strength of 4000 psi for all load-bearing slabs.

assistant:
The foundation slab in Zone B must have a minimum compressive strength of 4000 psi at 28 days [Structural_Sheets.pdf#page=3], which was confirmed in the revised note on Sheet S3 [RFI_0043.pdf] and is consistent with the general spec for load-bearing slabs [SpecBook-Section03.pdf#page=12].
